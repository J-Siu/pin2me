- manifest.json CSP Removed: It is actually not required and properly left over from the early stage of development.

- BUILD.md and Build scripts updated
  - scripts/buildExt.sh will build both release and profile version
  - tested with flesh clone from github in new directory

- extension build steps
  BUILD.md
  -> [Build](#build)
    -> [Extension](#extension)

PS: first time 'flutter clean' error can be ignored.
